## Wolfram Cellular Automata Study

A deep analysis and result visualization of a Wolfram Rule Automata.

The notebook is written in python, but fully automatized and no programming experience is needed to change rules for analysis.

The notebook is generic and can be used for general time-series.


Run the notebooks directly on google colab:
