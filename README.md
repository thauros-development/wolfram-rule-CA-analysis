## Wolfram Cellular Automata Study

A deep analysis and result visualization of a Wolfram Rule Automata, inherently  a few philosophical notions. 

The notebook is written in python, but fully automatized and no programming experience is needed to change rules for analysis.
All CA Rules are listed in the Wolfram Atlas for Simple Programs: [[Link]](http://atlas.wolfram.com/01/01/) 

The notebook is generic and can be used for general time-series.

This notebook is slightly less polished and implements in addition:
- Dummy Signals for Referencing
    - Basic Sinusodial Signals with and without Harmonic Content
    - Logistic Function for Chaotic (Edge-of-chaos) Content
- UMAP (t-SNE) Multidimensional Scaling
- Spectogram
- Animated Oscilloscope
- Coherence between two Signals
- Signal Stationarity
- Granger-Causality Prediction
- SARIMAX Prediction / RMSE
