# Wolfram Cellular Automata Rule Analysis Notebook

This is a CA generation and analysis notebook.
The notebook is mostly generic and rules can easily be exchanged.
It uses concepts of signal processing, frequency analysis and statistical methods and is focussed on visualizations whenever possible.

It is most convenient to run the jupyter notebook directly on google colab, where it can be downloaded as well:
