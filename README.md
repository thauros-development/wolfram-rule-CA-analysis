# Wolfram Cellular Automata Rule Analysis Notebook

This is a CA generation and analysis notebook. There is currently Rule 57 (a very deterministic CA) and Rule 30, both with limited result interpretations. The notebook is however mostly generic and rules can easily be exchanged.
It uses concepts of signal processing, frequency analysis and statistical methods and is focussed on visualizations whenever possible.

It is most convenient to run the jupyter notebook directly on google colab, where it can be downloaded as well:
